# girotex_knitting_machine
A compilation of the maintenance and restoration of a 1950s/60s residential knitting machine.

This is going to be a collection of maintenanceandr restoration information for an antique Girotex-Handstrickapparat knitting machine.
I inherited this machine from my grandmother with minimal rusting, but many stuck and dirty pieces.
The intent is to eventually have this manual in html format to live on my empty neocities site.
