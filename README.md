# Project details
A compilation of maintenance and restoration information of a 1950s/60s residential knitting machine.

This is going to be a collection of maintenance and restoration information for an antique Girotex-Handstrickapparat knitting machine.  
I inherited this machine from my grandmother with minimal rusting, but many stuck and dirty pieces.  
The intent is to eventually have this manual in html format to live on my empty neocities site.  
The suppliers manual for a similar machine can be found [here](https://www.example.com)
